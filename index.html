                        A movie is “just” a fancy video.

                <h2>An "Influence metric"?</h2>
                <p>
                    We're interested in <strong>quantifying the change</strong> in incidence of Mia as a given name, around the release of Pulp Fiction in <b>1994.</b> To do so, let us zoom in around 1994 and <b>compare the slopes</b> between the datapoints before and after the release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We perform 2 separate linear regressions, one over <b>10 years prior</b> to the year of interest, and the other over <b>the year of interest and the 4 suceeding years.</b> Our metric is defined as the difference between the slopes computed by the two regressions: <strong>Δβ = β<sub>after</sub> - β<sub>before</sub>.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In essence, we are computing a weighted 2nd-order finite difference, so we are measuring the <strong>local convexity</strong> of the curve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because we are dealing with <b>real-world data,</b> convexity (or <b>acceleration</b>) is a better measure than slope itself for determining if changes are happening in the data — indeed, the increase or decrease in baby names is always <strong>gradual,</strong> which means just taking the tangent is not enough and we must look at the <b>change in tangents</b> over time around the year of interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our calculations, the following years are also <b>weighted more</b> than the preceding ones. The goal of such a weighting is to pick up more easily on <strong>sudden changes</strong> in the general direction of the slope.

                    Armed with our <b>amazing datasets</b> and our <b>powerful new metric,</b> we set out to answer a few related questions that appeared when playing around with the data. These questions arose mostly from curiosity, but also from a priori beliefs we might hold about movies, baby names and their influence on each other.

                    The important note here is that our analysis is <strong>mostly exploratory</strong> — in the sense that although we are indeed trying to answer a predefined question, our main purpose is <b>exploring</b> the dataset, trying many different ideas and seeing whether or not we obtain significant results that could later serve as a <b>starting point</b> for deeper, causal analysis.

                <h2>1: Effect of the movie release period of the year.</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Baby birth rates</strong> are <b>higher in the summer</b> than in the winter, which is due to higher conception rates in the autumn and winter periods <a href="https://rightasrain.uwmedicine.org/life/parenthood/winter-baby-conception-trend">(source)</a>. Let's find out if this fact implies that the movies released in this period affect more the name given to babies.

                </div>
                <p>
                    To tackle this question, we look at the <b>proportion of character</b> names related to a <b>significant slope increase</b> for their respective name. We can see that it is in fact <strong>in fall and winter</strong> that we have more significant names, which seems to contradict the premise of the study and our hypothesis. We note that the "region of influence" is unknown, i.e. maybe there exists a 6-month delay in the influence of names on baby names.
                </p>
                <div class="graph">

                <p>
                    When looking with respect to the <b>months</b> instead of the seasons, the difference between fall and winter period is even less clear. The <b>confidence interval is also large</b> which indicates we can't really conclude that there is a significant variation.

                    We remark here that in the 15 last years of the dataset, the proportion of significant movie releases is more or less 25% each, and stays consistent over the years. This is a first indication that we cannot reject H<sub>0</sub>, the data does not seem to show a significant difference of influence by movie character names over the seasons. There are more variations in older years, but this might be because there were less movies released then and thus the variance is higher.

                    One could think about romance movies, which are very sentimental and might impact strongly people's minds due to the emotional feelings they pass through the caracter. Or maybe comic or action movies — these are also strongly ingrained in the market and have their own set of associated feelings, although less on the compassion/feeling side but rather in the act of taking action or making people laugh, without especially giving the opportunity to the viewer to relate to a possible real life or dream love story which we might get through during our life.

                <h3>Mean influence of genre on baby names</h3>

                <p>
                    The first panel shows the average (positive and negative) <b>convexity</b> of popularity evolution of baby names that are <b>associated to movies of the genre</b>. In other words: for each movie in the genre, we look at the character names and how the <b>baby name slopes changed</b> around the release of that movie; then, we take the <strong>mean value</strong> over all characters of all movies associated with the genre. On the left, genres associated with local <b>convex curves</b> for baby names; on the right, concave curves, i.e. genres associated with a <b>mean deceleration</b> of number of babies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking at the graph, overall movies seem to have a postive impact on nameing. We also notice that genres such as "Biographical", "Film adaptation", and other in the same category that are tied to real life events have a stronger impact. However these values seem to be very small (compared to the next values).
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Absolute influence on baby names by genres
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The second panel also shows the <b>average convexity</b> of baby curves associated to movies of the genre; the difference is that we compute the <strong>absolute value</strong> of the convexity, which means negative and positive values don't cancel each other out and both count towards the total influence.
                </p>

                <h3>

                    Finally, we look at the <b>proportion of names</b> that present a significant (<code>α = 0.1</code>) change in slope after the release of the movie. The genres are separated with respect to the number of movies that they contain, with large genres (<code>n > 10,000</code>) on the left and small ones on the right.

                <h2>3: What's the effect of movie's popularity on baby naming?</h2>

                <h3>Matching on gender, character order, movie genre and year.</h3>

                <p>
                    We are exploring how the popularity of a film influences baby naming trends, considering various factors such as gender, character order, movie genre, and year of release. This comprehensive approach helps isolate the true impact of a film's popularity.
                </p>

                <b>Step 1: Establishing Dataframe</b>
                <p>
                    Our initial step involves setting up a comprehensive dataframe that includes all the required movie characteristics, forming the foundation of our analysis.
                </p>

                <b>Step 2: Creating Treatment and Control Groups</b>
                <p>
                    We then divide the data into treatment and control groups, distinguishing them based on the number of votes a film has received. Through this, we separe for isolating the effects of a film's popularity.
                </p>
            
                <b>Step 3: Matching</b>
                <p>
                    The matching process is where we pair films from the control and treatment groups. We ensure a balanced comparison while focusing on the variable of interest: the number of votes.
                </p>
            
                <b>Step 4: Analyzing Variations in Naming Trends</b>
                <p>
                    Finally, after matching, we analyze the yearly variations in the proportion of names influenced by movies.
                </p>

                <h3>Further discrimining the unpopular movies.</h3>
                <p>
                    We can try to modify the threshold of votes that determines the popularity. We always keep a threshold given by the distribution of the dataset, namely the 25th, 75th and 90th percentiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By doing so, we increase the size difference between the control and the treatment group, thus decrease the possible number of pairs, but we allow to better capture the effect popularity related to a movie and its effect on the influence on baby naming.
                </p>

                <iframe src="plots/q3/q3_prop_signi_matching.html" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:none;"></iframe>

                <h3>Does matching on year is relevant?</h3>
                <p>
                    So far we have performed perfect matching on 3 movies caracteristics as well as on the year of release. But is it really that important to match on the year ? Let's explore this question with another matching with same threshold on the popularity but no requirement for year equivalency in pairs between control and treatment group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result are displayed in the point-plot below and as we can clearly see:
                </p>
                <iframe src="plots/q3/q3_prop_signi_no_matching_year.html" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:none;"></iframe>
                <p>
                    We get quite an interesting result looking at this pointplot, especially that we cannot say that the difference in proportion of significantly influenced name between the popular and unpopular movies (median threshold) is significant anymore since the confidence interval do overlap!
                </p>

                <h3>What about the qualitative effect obtained with matching ?</h3>
                <p>
                    The previous analysis were performed on the proportion of significantly influenced names betweeen the control group of unpopular movies and the treated group of popular film to try to assess whether there was a statistically difference between the two after performing exact matching. We are now interested at the qualitative effect that could bring out this perfect matching, namely the difference in magnitude influence between the control and treated group. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Computation for several popularity threshold were made (25th, median, 75th, 90th percentile) and the first matching was performed considering only the significantly influenced names and matching on same order, movie genre, gender and year of release.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The results of difference in difference analysis is summarized in the dynamic pointplot below:
                </p>
                <iframe src="plots/q3/q3_average_magnitude_influence_matching.html" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:none;"></iframe>
                <p>
                    From that summary of difference in difference analysis through dynamic pointplot, we can observe that after matching on various popularity threshold, we cannot say that there is a statistically significant change in magnitude influence between popular and unpopular movies.

                    With this first inspection, we can see that the <strong>greater the importance of characters</strong> in the film (i.e. small order, a main character), the greater the number of characters <b>having a significant impact</b> on the names given to newborns. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This result is in line with what we might intuitively expect, that characters make more of an impression on the viewer than characters who appear only infrequently in the film.
                </p>

                    <div class="tile">Character name impact per order.</div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Looking at the <b>percentage of characters with a significant impact</b> within each character order allows us to identify which role type has the greatest number of character names influencing the names of newborns. Here the difference between the influence of the first and second role is too small to say for sure which role has the most influence (the overlap in CI is too large), but it is quite clear from the first 6 bars that character name influence on baby names <b>decreases</b> as the importance of the character decreases.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We note that for <b>lower-ranked roles</b> the confidence intervals are very large due to the sparsity of the data; for them, we do not conclude anything.
                </p>

                <h3>Study the sign of the influence.</h3>

                    <div class="tile">Mean Negative and Positive Slope Change by Order.</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    We note that the average slope change per order for negative impacts has a greater magnitude than for positive impacts. However, the proportion of <b>negatively impacting</b> character names represents less than a quarter of all significant slope change.
                </p>
                <div class="graph">
                    <iframe src="plots/q4/q4_slope_change_pos_neg_prop.html" style="width:100%; height:350px; border:none;"></iframe>
                    <div class="tile">Proportion of Negative and Positive Slope Change by Order.</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    For positive slope changes (as noted in the previous sub-question), we see that for the <b>first 5 orders</b> the influence tends to diminish the less important the character's role.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This could be intuitively explained by the fact that the <b>less important</b> a character is, the <b>less he or she will impact</b> the audience.
                </p>
                <div class="graph">

                </div>
                <p>
                    The <strong>magnitude of the slope change</strong> tends to <b>decrease</b> for the first 5 orders. This reflects the trend of positive slope changes, which are proportionally in the majority for each order.
                </p>

                <h3>Does the order of a name influence differently according to gender?</h3>

                </div>
                <p>
                    By looking at magnitude slope change <strong>per order and gender</strong> we notice that except for the first role and the 4th, it seems that for most roles <b>female character</b> names seem to influence more than male ones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the main role, the very <b>similar slope change values</b> for male and female could be explained by the fact that the main character tends to make an impression on the public's mind, regardless of gender.

                        ... we can say that the influence on baby names that a character within a movie will have <strong>depends on their role</strong> in said movie. The most important factor seems to be <b>the importance of their character role</b> in the plot, but gender also seems to have a significant impact for secondary characters.

                <p>
                    If we look at the magnitude of influence over the years, <b>differentiating male and female,</b> we can see a greater overall influence of <strong>female character</strong> names than male ones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We can see that on average <b>over all years,</b> female character names have a greater influence on baby names than male character names.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Moreover, if we look at the proportion of names that have had a significant impact, the proportion is also greater among women (<code>0.1262905</code> vs. <code>0.1054252</code> for men).
